                <h5>Audience</h5>
                <p>Visual Capitalist has a bunch of vis representations mostly revolving around economics, but the audience of this particular visualization is likely anyone who would see it on social media. COVID-19 is something that everyone is very aware of at the moment and we personally found this on social media in the first place.                </p>
                
                <h5>Message and Questions</h5>
                <p>The visualization conveys and answers a number of things. It chronologically arranges recorded pandemics throughout history and compares their death tolls. </p>

                <h5>Data Encoded</h5>
                <p>The visualization encodes names for pandemics, the range of years in which they occurred, and the number of deaths as a result of them.</p>

                <h5>How the Encoding Works</h5>
                <p>Pandemics are differentiated by colors arbitrarily selected to represent them, with each one taking the form of a furry microbe. The microbes themselves are a sort of generalization as this visualization does not distinguish between viral and bacterial pandemics, and these microbes are highly stylized appearances for bacteria. Time is represented on a sort of y-axis that every microbe is placed on-- earlier years are placed at the top of the timeline with a grid delineating each range of years on the timeline. Perspective is skewed such that there are larger intervals from grid to grid near higher y-positions (i.e. the first interval is 200) and smaller ones near the closer-up years (25 year intervals). This grid and the years labelled next to them are grayscaled. Each microbe has a label attached to it displaying its name, casualties, and an exact recorded range for the pandemic.</p>
            
                <h5>Reader's Tasks</h5>
                <p>Readers compare values for death tolls by looking at the size of the microbes. Readers also look at trends in the size of death tolls throughout the year by essentially searching for white space on the timeline positionally.</p>

                <h5>The Five Principals</h5>
                <p>The visualization can be considered truthful on the whole. It has tags attached to every microbe explicitly stating death tolls and years of existence, in tandem with the positional and size-based analysis readers are expected to do. It is also functional, as it is very readable and appropriately displays important information. In terms of beauty, it’s clear that the creator may have actually made some sacrifices in truthfulness in order to make it look better. The use of perspective is extremely appealing and the image used for the microbes is an appealing way of displaying such morbid subject matter. The visualization is not extremely insightful, but does do a good job of showing just how cataclysmic some pandemics have been, like the Bubonic Plague and Spanish Flu. This is enlightening, as it reminds readers of just how powerful a pandemic can be, and how many could potentially die of them.</p>

                <h5>The Verdict</h5>
                <p>Considering all these aspects, I’d consider this visualization good for a number of reasons. It offers well-assembled and concise information about pandemics throughout history and does so in a very visually appealing way. It also does a good job of putting the sheer magnitude of some of these pandemics into perspective, but it does have negatives. The chart fails to account for deaths as a function of total world population, something which would make the Bubonic Plague so large on this timeline that it might not even be visible. Furthermore, the size of older pandemics’ microbes are not completely accurately portrayed-- predominantly because the perspective is skewed such that more recent pandemics are positioned closer and made larger. However, the visualization makes up for this by creating a ranking beneath it where the microbes are ranked with their area as a function of their death toll. Even though it’s not entirely accurate in its positioning and size for the microbes, these concessions are made for the sake of beauty and message, and the tradeoff is worth it. Furthermore, at first glance, it might be possible for people to misinterpret the visualization and think COVID isn’t as big a threat as it is because the visualization needs to be manually updated to deal with the increasing death toll. However, the vis does make a point of putting down a starting date and declaring the pandemic is on-going, so it is still truthful in this regard. Currently, the death toll is nearly a million so if it was constantly being updated it would be very apparent that this is more serious than the swine flu with the microbe being larger than that of swine flu.                </p>

                <h3 class="marker">The Critique</h3>

                <h5>Audience</h5>
                <p>The audience is the American people especially highlighting those in Utah, Colorado, Arizona, Washington, and California where there has been major delays in counting the mail-in-votes in previous elections.</p>
                
                <h5>Message and Questions</h5>
                <p>The visualization demonstrates the delays in the previous elections in some states that took multiple days to complete counting the votes. It seems to offer an answer to the relevant question of whether or not vote-by-mail is a good option for the presidential election.                </p>
                
                <h5>Data Encoded</h5>
                <p>The visualization encodes the percentages of votes counted in each day starting on the day the polls closed.</p>

                <h5>How the Encoding Works</h5>
                <p>This is a line graph with an inverted vertical axis and the area above the line is filled (to represent the number of votes left to count). It uses different shades of the blue color to distinguish between the states. There is a dotted vertical line where the average is.                </p>

                <h5>Reader's Tasks</h5>
                <p>Identify the states that took the longest time to finish counting votes. Notice the average of the five states in the middle of the graph.                </p>
                
                <h5>The Five Principals</h5>
                <p>The visualization is truthful because it represents the data in a way that isn’t deceiving. It is straightforward to understand. The graph is insightful and functional because it uses previous elections to reveal vital information for this upcoming election. The graph, although simple, is enlightening because it is very relevant with the tension between the current President and the United States Postal Service regarding the upcoming election. There have been numerous tensions regarding mail-in votes, and the USPS should be able to use data from past elections to be able to better handle the presidential election.                </p>
                
                <h5>The Verdict</h5>
                <p>Overall, this visualization is good because it displays information about the past elections in a manner that is concise and clear to understand. The design is simple but visually appealing as it isn’t overwhelming with information. The graph raises questions about if the USPS is ready to handle the election, and perhaps suggests that more time should be given to ensure that all of the votes are counted properly.                </p>

                <h5>Audience</h5>
                <p>The audience of this visualization is anyone interested in cooking-- whether figuring out what they could make with the ingredients they have on hand or brainstorming new recipes.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Message and Questions</h5>
                <p>This visualization asks the question “which foods pair well with different types of fish”, based on research of recipes and food science from BBCfoods and Epicurious. It conveys ingredients that synergize well with different proteins. 
                </p>

                <h5>Data Encoded</h5>
                <p>The visualization encodes different types of general proteins, their subtypes (i.e. shrimp and sushi are both classified as fish but have different flavor profiles), and complements to each of these subtypes.
                </p>

                <h5>How the Encoding Works</h5>
                <p>The visualization encodes different types of primary ingredients in a sort of rounded tree structure. The screenshot included only displays the part of the visualization dealing with fish. Each tree has its own root node, the main ingredient (i.e. fish), connecting to a child node, the specific type of that ingredient (i.e. smoked fish, white fish, crab, etc in this example), connecting to numerous children leaves which encode complimentary ingredients.
                </p>
                
                <h5>Reader's Tasks</h5>
                <p>Readers would likely use this visualization just as a reference. By looking at the type of fish (for example) they want to prepare, they can then create a dish using some of the complimentary ingredients. 
                </p>

                <h5>The Five Principals</h5>
                <p>To the most of our knowledge, the data in this visualization is truthful as it is sourced from food research done by reputable companies in the form of the BBC and Epicurious. It is also very functional, as via recognition readers can very easily reference the protein they have access to and within seconds determine some synergistic side ingredients. The data isn’t very beautified, but its simple design makes it much easier to look at and quickly identify an ingredient. This is also very insightful, as it reveals ingredient synergies very rapidly that individuals not experienced in cooking or food sciences simply might not know about. Likewise, it is enlightening as many of these synergies are not overtly obvious, such as octopus and chilli.
                </p>

                <h5>The Verdict</h5>
                <p>	This visualization is good because, simply put, it does its job efficiently. It could potentially be more space efficient (seeing as each protein needs its own independent tree), but that would likely be at the cost of some ease of recognition. As it is, it’s very easy to look at the set of trees and find what you’re looking for. The only potential weakness we can think about in terms of insightfulness is that the visualization only displays synergies between proteins and side ingredients. If someone were to create a recipe for one of the proteins using every single one of its synergistic ingredients, it would end up very strange (i.e. shrimp, cheese, and curry is a very strange combination). As a quickly referenced resource it does a great job of displaying some potential ingredients to add to your main protein, even if it doesn’t explicitly describe synergies between each of these individual side dishes or seasonings. For these reasons, it is a good visualization.

                <h5>Audience</h5>
                <p>The audience is potential investors in the global vegan cheese market as posted by Zion, a market research company.                 </p>
                
                <h5>Message and Questions</h5>
                <p>The visualization conveys current market value of the global vegan cheese market, as well as 2026 value. It seems like it attempts to answer the question “Should I invest in global vegan cheese”.                </p>
                
                <h5>Data Encoded</h5>
                <p>The visualization encodes market value in USD, as well as CAGR or compound annual growth rate.
                </p>
                
                <h5>How the Encoding Works</h5>
                <p>	The visualization uses a pie chart with two slices labelled 2018 and 2026 and their market value in USD respectively. CAGR is labeled in text just on the background, which is a photo of vegan cheese.                </p>

                <h5>Reader's Tasks</h5>
                <p>Readers look at the difference in 2018 market value and projected 2026 market value to identify a trend. The value for CAGR bolsters this insight.                </p>
                
                <h5>The Five Principals</h5>
                <p>The visualization is truthful to the extent that it reports data in numbers, but the pie chart does not accurately represent anything. It’s completely dysfunctional because it makes no sense to compare 2018 market value with a projected 2026 market value within a pie chart. A pie chart is never really the best idiom to use, but even then it’s only really usable when looking at proportions of a total-- if the pie chart was representing the entire market for cheese and showing how big the vegan cheese slices was it would be a little more helpful.  The visualization isn’t beautiful at all, both the background and pie chart look overwhelmingly cheap, and the pie chart looks like it is created with SmartArt graphics. The text and font also look very ugly, and do not mesh well with the background. The visualization is insightful to the extent that it shows growth in the vegan cheese market which might inspire people to invest in it, but whatever trustworthiness that project has is ruined by the unprofessional appearance of the actual graphic. It’s at least a little bit enlightening that vegan cheese is predicted to increase in market value, but in the end this is just a projection with only two displayed data points.                </p>                
                
                <h5>The Verdict</h5>
                <p>This visualization is essentially bad in every way. The use of a pie chart is completely inappropriate for the data presented, the background is unprofessional and not visually appealing, there is no unity between the aesthetic of the pie chart and the background, and finally 3/5ths of the pie chart isn’t even used.</p>
                
                <h5>Better Graphs</h5>
                <p>In order to improve on this design, it’s a good idea to first of all entirely ditch the pie chart approach. Based on the original visualization, it appears Zion was interested in displaying a projected increase in market value of vegan cheese, but with the use of the pie chart it also appeared they wanted to compare its market value and growth to that of non-vegan competitors. Therefore, using a stacked bar chart allows us to display both the market values and projected market values of vegan cheese, but also a comparison in growth between it and non-vegan cheese. If the end goal is to inform a reader’s decision to invest, this comparison between vegan and non-vegan is necessary. 
                    Market values of the entire cheese market, non-vegan, and vegan cheese were encoded via size. Vegan and non-vegan were encoded using different colors. Market value is presented quantitatively as the dependent variable (we made up values for this sketch), but market share is also encoded as a proportion between size of one color to size of another. Year is encoded quantitatively on a year to year interval on the x-axis.</p>

                <p>The audience are the American Citizens and all over the world who are interested about the unemployment rate in 2011.</p>
                
                <h5>Message and Questions</h5>
                <p>It conveys the number of unemployment rates of 2011 when Obama was the president.</p>
                
                <h5>Data Encoded</h5>
                <p>The visualization encodes the unemployment rate with each month of 2011 which value in percentage (%).</p>
                
                <h5>How the Encoding Works</h5>
                <p>On the y axis it shows the percentage of the unemployment rates and on the X axis to represent the month from Jan- Nov. It also uses a red circle to show the percentage and connects all of the months to show a trend.</p>
                
                <h5>Reader's Tasks</h5>
                <p>The task readers perform on the visualization is to see if the unemployment rate is growing or is stable.</p>
                
                <h5>The Five Principals</h5>
                <p>The visualization is not truthful because the value is not placed correctly. It is functional and beautiful. The graph is insightful and englightning because it give a information about unemployment rate of past couple months.</p>
                
                <h5>The Verdict</h5>
                <p>The visualization is bad because the value for November (8.6) is not placed correctly. It’s placed near the 9.0 position. It is trying to manipulate the information to make the audience look like the overall employment trend is growing while it is stable.</p>
                
                <h5>Better Graphs</h5>
                <p>The way we created this graph was by thinking about all the problems that were there on the chart given above and solving one the next one. The main problem that we saw was the bar was placed in the wrong plot. This graph is better because the percentages are correctly placed and the audience can clearly see the trend of the unemployment rates. The graph above tries to manipulate the trend to make it look like that the unemployment rate was growing while it was not. The first graph that we created is transparent of all the data.
                    The second graph gives more simplified information to the audience.  When we viewed the first graph through an audience perspective, we found the first graph was a little more time consuming. We wanted the second one to be less time consuming and more simplified. We found out that the first graph is time consuming due to the number percentage and that is why we decided to get rid of it. We also realized that the main point of the graph is to let the audience know about the unemployment trend, which we were still able to deliver while getting rid of the percentage. We showed the second graph to our other roommates and they were able to receive the information from the second graph faster and more clearly.

                <h5>Audience</h5>
                <p>The audience are the American Citizens and all over the world who are interested about the unemployment rate in 2011.</p>
                
                <h5>Message and Questions</h5>
                <p>It conveys the number of unemployment rates of 2011 when Obama was the president.</p>
                
                <h5>Data Encoded</h5>
                <p>The visualization encodes the unemployment rate with each month of 2011 which value in percentage (%).</p>
                
                <h5>How the Encoding Works</h5>
                <p>On the y axis it shows the percentage of the unemployment rates and on the X axis to represent the month from Jan- Nov. It also uses a red circle to show the percentage and connects all of the months to show a trend.</p>
                
                <h5>Reader's Tasks</h5>
                <p>The task readers perform on the visualization is to see if the unemployment rate is growing or is stable.</p>
                
                <h5>The Five Principals</h5>
                <p>The visualization is not truthful because the value is not placed correctly. It is functional and beautiful. The graph is insightful and englightning because it give a information about unemployment rate of past couple months.</p>
                
                <h5>The Verdict</h5>
                <p>The visualization is bad because the value for November (8.6) is not placed correctly. It’s placed near the 9.0 position. It is trying to manipulate the information to make the audience look like the overall employment trend is growing while it is stable.</p>
                
                <h5>Better Graphs</h5>
                <p>To make the visualization better the first thing that came to our minds was different colors for the different line chart that represents the different places where air strikes have landed. This makes it better, in our view, because it alleviates some of the difficulties that comes with having a hard time to differentiate the different places more easily. For the second visualization, we incorporated another section called peace place. The reason for this is because we believe it gives the user a better perspective of what places are peaceful and what places have had airstrikes. This is better because it shows one, an area where people can be safe because it is a currently going on situation. 
                    In addition, the reason for the peace place category addition is to give a more wider perspective as to how much of Yemen was peaceful and how much has been demolished as it went through time. In the third image, we tried to expand on the second visualization by including a yearly cycle in a circular way almost like a clock and to show the intensity we used heights within the circle of a designated year.

                <p>In order to improve on this design, it’s a good idea to first of all entirely ditch the pie chart approach. Based on the original visualization, it appears Zion was interested in displaying a projected increase in market value of vegan cheese, but with the use of the pie chart it also appeared they wanted to compare its market value and growth to that of non-vegan competitors. Therefore, using a stacked bar chart allows us to display both the market values and projected market values of vegan cheese, but also a comparison in growth between it and non-vegan cheese. If the end goal is to inform a reader’s decision to invest, this comparison between vegan and non-vegan is necessary. 
                </p>
                <p>Market values of the entire cheese market, non-vegan, and vegan cheese were encoded via size. Vegan and non-vegan were encoded using different colors. Market value is presented quantitatively as the dependent variable (we made up values for this sketch), but market share is also encoded as a proportion between size of one color to size of another. Year is encoded quantitatively on a year to year interval on the x-axis.
                </p>
                <p>This redesign is, we’d wager, a complete improvement upon the original. No part of the original worked properly, with the only real takeaway being that the market value of vegan cheese is projected to grow almost two fold by 2026. Because the intended audience of the original is potential investors, if the visualization is actually supposed to inform this investment it has to give individuals a reason to invest in vegan cheese as opposed to non-vegan. The use of a stacked bar chart which also includes the non-vegan value is vital for this audience. Furthermore, investing is a serious endeavor and slapping a low quality PNG file onto the back of the visualization does not give investors vital information.

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The way we created this graph was by thinking about all the problems that were there on the chart given above and solving one the next one. The main problem that we saw was the bar was placed in the wrong plot. This graph is better because the percentages are correctly placed and the audience can clearly see the trend of the unemployment rates. The graph above tries to manipulate the trend to make it look like that the unemployment rate was growing while it was not. The first graph that we created is transparent of all the data.
                    The second graph gives more simplified information to the audience.  When we viewed the first graph through an audience perspective, we found the first graph was a little more time consuming. We wanted the second one to be less time consuming and more simplified. We found out that the first graph is time consuming due to the number percentage and that is why we decided to get rid of it. We also realized that the main point of the graph is to let the audience know about the unemployment trend, which we were still able to deliver while getting rid of the percentage. We showed the second graph to our other roommates and they were able to receive the information from the second graph faster and more clearly.
